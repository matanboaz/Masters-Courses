### Course 52518: Statistical Models & thier analysis - Syllabus

* HU Credits: 3
* Degree: 1st degree (Bachelor)
* Responsible Department: statistics
* Semester: 1st Semester
* Teaching Languages: Hebrew
* Course Coordinator: Prof. David Zucker
* Course description: Analysis of variance, logistic regression, Poisson regression, analysis of categorical data 
* Course Content: 
  - Analysis of Variance (ANOVA):
    * One-way ANOVA: model formulation, checking the assumptions of normality and equality of variances, alternatives when the assumptions do not hold. Simultaneous confidence intervals – methods of Bonferroni, Scheffe and Tukey. 
    * Two-way ANOVA: model parameterization, interactions. Balanced and unbalanced designs.
    * ANOVA models with random effects: Testing hypotheses, confidence intervals for variance components, expected sums of squares, mixed-effects models.
  - Analysis of a binary response - logistic regression:
    * model definition and interpretation, estimation using iteratively reweighted least squares, hypothesis tests and confidence intervals, model checking 
  - Poisson regression for count data 
  - Analysis of categorical variables:
    * log-linear models and types of dependence, different sampling plans, goodness of fit, choosing a model.
* Course evaluation:
  - End of year written/oral examination 70 %
  - Quizzes 30 %
* Additional information: 
  - Course Requirments
    1. Final exam (in standard format) 
    2. Exercises:
      - An exercise set will be given every week. The exercises must be handed in.
      - It is permitted (and even recommended) to turn in the exercises in pairs.
      -I will mark the exercises as acceptable or not acceptable without a numerical grade. 
        * An acceptable exercise is an exercise that is turned in on time, written in a neat and organized fashion, and reflects a serious effort to answer the questions
    3. Quizzes:
      - During the course of the semester there will be three take-home mid-term quizzes, in a similar format to the exercises.
      - The quizzes will be checked in depth and assigned a numerical grade.
      - Here also it is permitted (and even recommended) to turn in the quizzes in pairs.
    4. Remark:
      - During the course we will be using the statistical package R.
